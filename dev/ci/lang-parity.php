 * \brief   Fail when a key exists in en_US but not in fr_FR.
 *
 * Dolibarr falls back to en_US when the current language file has no entry for a key. A key
 * that only exists in en_US therefore stays in English, and since a language file is loaded
 * for the whole request, the English wording leaks into every module that translates the same
 * generic key. The consumer always loses that race, so it has to be fixed at the source.
 *
 * The other direction - a French key with no English counterpart - is only a missing
 * translation, never a bug: it is counted and printed, never fatal.
 *
 * Every .lang file of langs/en_US is compared with its fr_FR counterpart, so a file added
 * later is covered without touching this script. A module that ships French only has nothing
 * to compare and passes.
 *
 * Usage: php dev/ci/lang-parity.php
